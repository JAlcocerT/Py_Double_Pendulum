# Py_Double_Pendulum

Understanding **Chaos Theory** with a simulation of a **Double Pendulum with Python** and Streamlit. Observe how deterministic and yet chaotic systems behave.

My **goal** with this project, open to everyone, irrespective of one's grounding in science, mathematics or IT skills  is more than just creating an interactive digital simulation of a Double Pendulum. 

Here, we are not merely observing the erratic dance of the Double Pendulum but we are invited into a deeper realm of contemplation.

This particular Double Pendulum example can serve as a mirror, prompting us to recognize the parallels between the pendulum's unpredictable swings and the intricate web of events and decisions that shape our lives. In every unexpected twist of the pendulum, there's a reflection of life's unforeseen turns, of choices that lead to vastly different outcomes, and of tiny events that cascade into monumental changes.

*In the dance of the Double Pendulum, **as in life**, the smallest shift can lead to the wildest of changes.*
